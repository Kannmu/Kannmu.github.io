##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

The ACM Digital Library is a comprehensive repository of resources in the field of computer science and information technology. It provides access to a diverse range of scholarly articles, conference proceedings, technical reports, and other publications related to computer science and its various sub-disciplines.

###  1.1. <a name='DevelopmentHistory'></a>Development History

ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), established in 1947, stands as the world's oldest and largest institution dedicated to computer education and research. With a diverse membership exceeding 90,000 individuals from various sectors, such as business, academia, and government, ACM extends its reach to more than 100 countries across the globe. The inception of the ACM Digital Library dates back to 1999.

In recent years, ACM has taken significant steps to enhance its Full-text Database, encompassing materials dating from the 1950s onwards. This expansion integrates publications from Special Interest Groups (SIGs), newsletters, and conference proceedings. Moreover, ACM has seamlessly integrated third-party publishers' content and the bibliographic abstract database known as "The Guide to Computing Literature." This integration effectively combines ACM's publications with those of over 3,000 other publishers, resulting in a comprehensive resource for the field of computing and information technology.

In 2014, ACM forged a partnership with Morgan & Claypool to introduce the ACM BOOKS series, covering the entire spectrum of computer sciences. This collaborative effort further enriches the wealth of knowledge and resources available through ACM.

###  1.2. <a name='ResourceTypes'></a>Resource Types

The ACM Digital Library includes a variety of resource types, such as:

1. The Full-Text Collection of all ACM publications, including journals, conference proceedings, technical magazines, newsletters and books.
2. A collection of curated and hosted full-text publications from select publishers.
3. The ACM Guide to Computing Literature, a comprehensive bibliographic database focused exclusively on the field of computing.
4. A richly interlinked set of connections among authors, works, institutions, and specialized communities.
5. The ACM Digital Library Board, oversees the design, operations and direction of the ACM Digital Library and supporting technology platforms.


###  1.3. <a name='ResourceQuantity'></a>Resource Quantity

The ACM Digital Library hosts a vast collection of resources, comprising thousands of articles, conference papers, reports, and other publications.

- 71 journals and magazines, all back to the original volume;
- Over 5,700 volumes of proceedings, with 275 volumes expected to be added each year;
- 38 ACM SIG (Special Interest Group) publications;
- "Online Computer Literature Guide" database: contains more than 2,800,800 abstracts from more than 5,000 publishing houses.

The exact number of resources may vary as new content is continually added to the database.

###  1.4. <a name='DisciplinaryCoverage'></a>Disciplinary Coverage

The ACM Digital Library covers a broad range of disciplines within computer science and information technology. It encompasses sub-disciplines such as artificial intelligence, data science, computer networks, software engineering, human-computer interaction, etc. The library aims to provide comprehensive coverage of the entire spectrum of computer science research.

**Friendliness:**Friendly and easy to use. The intuitive user interface provides easy operation and navigation. There are also some help documents or guides to better use the ACM database.

**<span style="color: blue;">Q:</span>** How do you feel about using ACM for the first time?

**<span style="color: red;">A:</span>** I feel a little confused when using ACMdatabase for the first time, and need some time to get familiar with the searchinterface and functions. But I was impressed by the rich academic resources and high quality papers included in the ACM database. It provides papers on a wide range of research areas and topics, which can help find relevant literature to support research efforts.

**<span style="color: blue;">Q:</span>** What are the problems encountered during use?

**<span style="color: red;">A:</span>** Don't know how to conduct an effective search. Because not familiar with using Boolean operators, wildcards, quotation marks and other advanced search techniques, it takes some time to learn and master these techniques in order to find the required data more accurately.
