##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a>Introduction

The ACM Digital Library is a comprehensive repository of resources in the field of computer science and information technology. It provides access to a diverse range of scholarly articles, conference proceedings, technical reports, and other publications related to computer science and its various sub-disciplines.

###  1.1. <a name='DevelopmentHistory'></a>Development History

ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), established in 1947, stands as the world's oldest and largest institution dedicated to computer education and research. With a diverse membership exceeding 90,000 individuals from various sectors, such as business, academia, and government, ACM extends its reach to more than 100 countries across the globe. The inception of the ACM Digital Library dates back to 1999.

In recent years, ACM has taken significant steps to enhance its Full-text Database, encompassing materials dating from the 1950s onwards. This expansion integrates publications from Special Interest Groups (SIGs), newsletters, and conference proceedings. Moreover, ACM has seamlessly integrated third-party publishers' content and the bibliographic abstract database known as "The Guide to Computing Literature." This integration effectively combines ACM's publications with those of over 3,000 other publishers, resulting in a comprehensive resource for the field of computing and information technology.

In 2014, ACM forged a partnership with Morgan & Claypool to introduce the ACM BOOKS series, covering the entire spectrum of computer sciences. This collaborative effort further enriches the wealth of knowledge and resources available through ACM.
